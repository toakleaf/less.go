Fix import-reference test in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. CSS imports are being processed instead of kept as @import statements.

YOUR SINGLE TASK:
- Fix 1 test ONLY: import-reference
- Error: "open test.css: no such file or directory"
- Files to check: import_visitor.go, import_manager.go, import.go
- Branch: claude/fix-import-reference-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-import-reference/TASK.md for full details.

THE PROBLEM:
When importing CSS files, they should remain as @import statements in output, NOT be loaded and processed as LESS files.

Test code has:
  @import (reference) url("import-once.less");
  @import (reference) url("css-3.less");

But it's trying to open ".css" files and process them.

Start by testing:
cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/import-reference" -v

KEY FIX NEEDED:
In import_manager.go, detect .css file extension and keep as @import statement instead of processing.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Must pass import-reference test ONLY
- Create branch, commit, push when done

SUCCESS: Report "Fixed import-reference test. Ready for PR."
