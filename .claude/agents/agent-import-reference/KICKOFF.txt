Fix import-reference test in less.go

CONTEXT: You're working on a Go port of less.js at https://github.com/toakleaf/less.go. CSS imports are being processed instead of kept as @import statements.

YOUR SINGLE TASK: Fix CSS import handling for 1 test

FAILING TEST:
- import-reference

ERROR: "open test.css: no such file or directory"

THE BUG: CSS files should remain as @import statements, NOT be loaded/processed as LESS.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read .claude/agents/agent-import-reference/TASK.md for details
2. Test the issue:
   cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
   go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/import-reference" -v
3. Fix it (likely in import_manager.go - detect .css extension)
4. Verify fix:
   go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/import-reference" -v
   pnpm -w test:go:unit
5. Create branch: claude/fix-import-reference-<your-session-id>
6. Commit with clear message
7. Push: git push -u origin claude/fix-import-reference-<your-session-id>
8. Create PR:
   gh pr create --title "Fix import-reference: handle CSS imports correctly" \
     --body "CSS files now remain as @import statements instead of being processed as LESS.

Test fixed:
- import-reference

Added CSS file detection in import manager to keep .css imports as-is in output.

Closes #[issue-number-if-exists]"

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- No regressions

SUCCESS: Report "✅ Fixed import-reference test. PR created: [URL]"
