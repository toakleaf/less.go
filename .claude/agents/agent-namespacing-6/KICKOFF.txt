Fix namespacing-6 test in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. Mixin calls assigned to variables fail when called.

YOUR SINGLE TASK:
- Fix 1 test ONLY: namespacing-6
- Error: "Could not evaluate variable call @alias"
- The code: @alias: .something(foo); @alias(); ← this fails
- Files to check: variable_call.go, variable.go, mixin_call.go
- Branch: claude/fix-namespacing-6-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-namespacing-6/TASK.md for full details.

THE PROBLEM:
When you assign a mixin call to a variable and then call it:
  @alias: .something(foo);  // Store mixin result
  @alias();                 // Call it - FAILS

Start with trace:
cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
LESS_GO_TRACE=1 go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/namespacing/namespacing-6" -v 2>&1 | grep -i alias

Look in variable_call.go for "Could not evaluate variable call" error.

HINT: Similar to Issue #2 (detached-rulesets) which was fixed by checking Eval(any) (any, error) signature before Eval(any) any. You might need a similar pattern.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Must pass namespacing-6 test ONLY
- Create branch, commit, push when done

SUCCESS: Report "Fixed namespacing-6 test. Ready for PR."
