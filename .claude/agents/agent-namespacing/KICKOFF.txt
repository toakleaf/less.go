Fix namespace variable call evaluation in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. Mixin calls assigned to variables fail when called.

YOUR TASK:
- Fix 2 failing tests: namespacing-6, namespacing-functions
- Error: "Could not evaluate variable call @alias"
- Code: @alias: .something(foo); @alias(); ← fails
- Files to check: variable_call.go, variable.go, mixin_call.go, detached_ruleset.go
- Branch: claude/fix-namespacing-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-namespacing/TASK.md for full details.

Start with trace to understand the flow:
cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
LESS_GO_TRACE=1 go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/namespacing/namespacing-6" -v 2>&1 | grep -i alias

Look for "Could not evaluate variable call" in variable_call.go - that's where it fails.

Similar to Issue #2 (detached-rulesets) which was fixed by checking Eval(any) (any, error) before Eval(any) any. Your issue might need similar pattern.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Must pass both namespacing tests
- Create branch, commit, push when done
