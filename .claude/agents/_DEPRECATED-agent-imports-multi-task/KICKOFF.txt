Fix import reference functionality in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. Import reference handling has bugs.

YOUR TASK:
- Fix 2-3 of 5 import tests
- Target: import-reference, import-reference-issues, (stretch: import-module)
- DEFER: import-interpolation (architectural), google (network issue)
- Files to check: import_visitor.go, import_manager.go, import.go, set_tree_visibility_visitor.go
- Branch: claude/fix-imports-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-imports/TASK.md for full details.

KEY ISSUES:
1. import-reference: CSS files being processed instead of kept as @import statements
2. import-reference-issues: Referenced mixins not accessible (#Namespace > .mixin undefined)

THE CONCEPT:
@import (reference) should:
- Make mixins/variables available
- NOT output the imported CSS by default
- Only output explicitly used selectors

Start by testing:
cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/import-reference" -v

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Create branch, commit, push when done

NOTE: agent-paths also touches import_manager.go but they focus on path searching. You focus on reference flags and CSS detection. Different sections.
