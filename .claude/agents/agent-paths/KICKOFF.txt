Fix include path resolution for imports in less.go

CONTEXT: You're working on a Go port of less.js at https://github.com/toakleaf/less.go. Imports aren't being resolved through configured include paths.

YOUR SINGLE TASK: Fix include path resolution for 1 test

FAILING TEST:
- include-path

ERROR: "open import-test-e: no such file or directory"

THE BUG: Files should be searched in configured include paths, but they're not.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read .claude/agents/agent-paths/TASK.md for details
2. Find where the file actually is:
   find packages/test-data -name "*import-test-e*"
3. Check test configuration:
   grep -A10 "include-path" packages/less/src/less/less_go/integration_suite_test.go
4. Fix (likely need to either):
   - Add include path config to test, OR
   - Fix import_manager.go to search include paths
5. Verify fix:
   go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite.*include-path" -v
   pnpm -w test:go:unit
6. Create branch: claude/fix-include-path-<your-session-id>
7. Commit with clear message
8. Push: git push -u origin claude/fix-include-path-<your-session-id>
9. Create PR:
   gh pr create --title "Fix include path resolution for imports" \
     --body "Imports now search configured include paths when files aren't found relative to current file.

Test fixed:
- include-path

Added include path configuration and/or fixed import manager to properly search configured paths.

Closes #[issue-number-if-exists]"

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- No regressions

SUCCESS: Report "✅ Fixed include-path test. PR created: [URL]"
