Fix include path resolution for imports in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. Imports aren't being resolved through configured include paths.

YOUR TASK:
- Fix 1 failing test: include-path
- Error: "open import-test-e: no such file or directory"
- Files to check: integration_suite_test.go, import_manager.go, file_manager.go
- Branch: claude/fix-paths-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-paths/TASK.md for full details.

Start by finding where the file actually is:
find packages/test-data -name "*import-test-e*"

Then check if the test configures include paths:
grep -A10 "include-path" packages/less/src/less/less_go/integration_suite_test.go

Likely need to either:
A) Add include path config to test, OR
B) Fix import_manager.go to search include paths, OR
C) Both

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Create branch, commit, push when done

NOTE: agent-imports also touches import_manager.go but different sections. You focus on path searching, they focus on reference flags.
