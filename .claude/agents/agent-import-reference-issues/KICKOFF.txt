Fix import-reference-issues test in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. Referenced imports aren't making mixins accessible.

YOUR SINGLE TASK:
- Fix 1 test ONLY: import-reference-issues
- Error: "#Namespace > .mixin is undefined"
- Files to check: import_visitor.go, import.go, set_tree_visibility_visitor.go
- Branch: claude/fix-import-reference-issues-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-import-reference-issues/TASK.md for full details.

THE PROBLEM:
@import (reference) should:
- Make mixins/variables available for use
- NOT output the imported CSS by default
- Only output CSS for explicitly used selectors

But currently referenced mixins are not accessible.

Start by testing:
cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/import-reference-issues" -v

KEY CONCEPT:
The `reference` flag should mark imports so their mixins are accessible but CSS isn't output unless explicitly used (via extend or mixin call).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Must pass import-reference-issues test ONLY
- Create branch, commit, push when done

SUCCESS: Report "Fixed import-reference-issues test. Ready for PR."
