Fix URL parsing with escaped characters in less.go

CONTEXT: You're working on a Go port of less.js at https://github.com/toakleaf/less.go. The parser is 92% working but URLs with escaped parentheses cause errors.

YOUR SINGLE TASK: Fix URL parsing for 2 tests (same fix applies to both)

FAILING TESTS:
- urls (main suite)
- urls (compression suite)

ERROR: "expected ')' got '('" when parsing:
  url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=\"Rokkitt\":\(400\),700)

THE BUG: The parser sees \( as an opening paren instead of escaped character.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read .claude/agents/agent-urls/TASK.md for details
2. Test the issue:
   cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
   go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/urls" -v
3. Fix it (likely in url.go or parser.go around line 3270)
4. Verify fix:
   go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/urls" -v
   go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/compression/urls" -v
   pnpm -w test:go:unit
5. Create branch: claude/fix-urls-<your-session-id>
6. Commit with clear message
7. Push: git push -u origin claude/fix-urls-<your-session-id>
8. Create PR:
   gh pr create --title "Fix URL parsing with escaped characters" \
     --body "Fixes URL parsing to handle escaped parentheses like \( and \).

Tests fixed:
- urls (main suite)
- urls (compression suite)

The parser was treating escaped characters as syntax. Updated escape handling to treat backslash-escaped characters as literals.

Closes #[issue-number-if-exists]"

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- No regressions

SUCCESS: Report "✅ Fixed 2 URL tests. PR created: [URL]"
