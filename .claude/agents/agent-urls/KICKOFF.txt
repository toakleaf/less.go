Fix URL parsing to handle escaped characters in less.go

You're working on a Go port of less.js. URLs with escaped parentheses like \( cause parser errors.

YOUR TASK:
- Fix 2 failing tests: urls (main + compression suites)
- Error: "expected ')' got '('" when parsing url(http://example.com?family=\"Font\":\(400\))
- Files to check: url.go, parser.go (line ~3270), parser_input.go
- Branch: claude/fix-urls-<your-session-id>

Read .claude/agents/agent-urls/TASK.md for full details.

Start by running:
cd packages/less/src/less/less_go
go test -run "TestIntegrationSuite/main/urls" -v

The regex at parser.go:3286 already tries to match escaped chars \\[()'"], but something's not working. Find and fix it.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Never modify .js files
- Must pass: pnpm -w test:go:unit
- Must pass both urls tests
- Create branch, commit, push when done
